# Chelone

The word **Chelone** is Ancient Greek for *Tortoise*, and has been used as a basis for the words *Chelonii* and *Chelonia*, historical alternative names for the [*Testudines*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle) biological order (turtles, tortoises and terrapins).
Since [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) often uses various turtles as mascots, it is fitting for a variability analysis tool to use a name that encompasses all kinds of turtles.
